## Goals

### Decentralized

Centralized payment facilitators bring with them a myriad of problems from high fees to the potential for censorship. By utilizing a decentralized blockchain contract there is no point of failure, no censorship and no arbitrary gatekeeping. 

### Immutable

A system that cannot be changed is a system that cannot be censored. 

### Easy to Use

In the past setting up your own subscription service has been too difficult for normal users. But with Clocktower if you can use a decentralized app you can create or subscribe to a subscription. 

### Inexpensive

Traditional payment networks justify charging high fees due to the high costs of setting up a traditional network. But by building on the existing backbone of EVM compliant blockchains we believe we can eventually undercut the price of traditional platforms. 

### No Oracles

An oracle is a third party data source. External sources of information can be incorrect or manipulated. This is too much of a risk for a payment platform. 

### Minimum tokens in contract

Hackers hack where the money is. Traditional contracts have become targets largely because they rely on the "vault" model where all value is stored within the contract. We seek to turn this model on its head by seeking to hold as little value as possible in the contract. This makes the contract less of a target and allows users to secure their own funds in their own wallets.
