## Goals

### Decentralized

While centralized payment facilitators are the norm they bring with them a myriad of problems from high fees to censorship. But with a decentralized blockchain contract there is no point of failure, no censorship and no arbitraty gatekeeping. 

### Immutable

A system that cannot be changed is a system that cannot be censored. 

### Easy to Use

In the past setting up your own subscription service has been too difficult for normal users. But with Clocktower if you can use a decentralized app you can create or join a subscription. 

### Inexpensive

Traditional payment networks have had the advantage fo being able to charge high fees due to extreme costs of setting up your own network. But by building on the existing backbone of EVM compliant blockchains we believe we can eventually undercut the existing networks. 

### No Oracles

An oracle is a third party data source. Relying on an external source of information outsources security to that source which is too insecure for a payment platform. 

### Minimum tokens in contract

Hackers hack where the money is. Traditional contracts have become targets largely because they rely on the "vault" model where all value is stored within the contract. We seek to turn this model on its head by seeking to hold as little value as possible in the contract. This makes the contract less of a target and allows users to keep secure their own funds in their own wallets. 

### No protocol token needed

We believe a protocol should never need its own token to work. A toekn needed for functionality creates friction for the user when they have to convert it and can lead to inflationary tokenomics. If Clocktower ever issued its own token it would solely be for governance purposes.
