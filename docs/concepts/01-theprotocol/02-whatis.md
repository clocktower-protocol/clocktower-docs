# What is Clocktower?

Clocktower is a decentralized system that allows for time aware processes. The Clocktower Protocol is a series of EVM compliant contracts that facilitate useful time dependent functions for users. By incorporating such features as subscriptions, future payments, batch transactions and ERC20 compatibility we hope to unlock the potential of other fintech and defi projects seeking a way to expand what is possible while staying true to the principles of immutability, simplicity and decentralization.
