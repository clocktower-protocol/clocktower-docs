## üåü What is Clocktower?

Clocktower is a decentralized system that allows for time-aware processes on the Ethereum blockchain. The Clocktower Protocol consists of EVM-compliant smart contracts that facilitate useful time-dependent functions for users, particularly focusing on recurring payments of ERC20 tokens.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Subscriptions**: Automated recurring payments without centralized intermediaries
- **Time-Aware Smart Contracts**: Leverages blockchain timing for scheduled transactions
- **Provider-Subscriber Model**: Enables content creators and service providers to monetize through subscriptions
- **Incentivized Callers**: Network participants are rewarded for maintaining the time-based functions
- **ERC20 Token Support**: Works with any ERC20 token for payments
